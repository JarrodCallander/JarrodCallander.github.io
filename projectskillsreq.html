				<h1>Skills required</h1>
				<p>A heavy amount of programming knowledge will be required to create a secure app that would be sufficient to deal with financial information. In addition, there would need to be stringent security measures in place around the monitoring of sensitive servers. Once the app and supporting infrastructure was designed pen testing would be required. The pen testing would be outsourced to a trusted Australian company and would not be conducted in house. The main issue surrounding feasibility would be the initial set up of infrastructure and finding the right balance of security and availability.</p>
