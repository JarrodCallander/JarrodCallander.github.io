				<h1>Outcome</h1>
				<p>If my project were successful there would be a payment app available to be purchased by a third-party such as a bank who has the resources to support the growth of the tool. The original problem of the hassle surrounding transferring money is solved by the simple app with an easy set up that can streamline the payment of bills in new relationships and shared households. Because the app makes payments simple and easy, I believe that this app has the potential to take the market by storm as proven by the numbers similar apps such as Afterpay has done â€“ In its half-yearly report in December 2018, Afterpay reported total revenue of $112.3 million, which was up by 85% compared to the previous year. <a href="https://www.bt.com.au/insights/perspectives/2019/05/buy-now-pay-later-the-rise-of-afterpay-and-zipco.html#:~:text=In%20its%20half%2Dyearly%20report">(www.bt.com.au, n.d.)</a></p>
