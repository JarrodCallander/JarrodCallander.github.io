				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
				<p>I believe the next step for me career wise is a job a <a href="https://boq-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.jobinfo&id=23&jobid=7832&company_id=16496&version=1&source=ONLINE&JobOwner=993144&level=levelid1&levelid1=36329&startflag=2">Senior Security Analyst at Bank of Queensland</a>. As a senior analyst the job is to help contribute to the overall security of Bank of Queensland’s daily operation. Senior analysts are generally called upon to help and provide deeper technical investigations into cyber security events and incidents and then develop reports to stakeholders on these incidents. The job appeals to me because I know already have experience in the field and I enjoy the analytical nature of the job. The reason I chose the job with Bank of Queensland is because it fulfills my personal requirement of being based in Brisbane but also quenches my professional desire to work in a highly targeted sector – finance and government. On the 19th of June 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the increased targeted, sustained cyber security attacks on Australia’s government and private sector. “Mr Morrison said the cyber attacks were widespread, covering "all levels of government" as well as essential services and businesses.” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-46096768 ">(Australia targeted by “state-based” cyber attacks, 2020).</a> Since I was a child, I relished the challenge of competition and think that if I go to work every day I want to be up against the best in the world. </p>

				<p>The role requires demonstrated experience in a SOC with senior responsibilities and in-depth knowledge in a variety of areas of IT security such as vulnerability management, cloud security, network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and, Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools. The final desirable for this job is a CISSP. Even once I have finished my degree, I will need to sit my CISSP exam as: “Candidates must have a minimum of five years cumulative paid work experience in two or more of the eight domains of the CISSP CBK. Earning a four-year college degree or regional equivalent or an additional credential from the (ISC)² approved list will satisfy one year of the required experience. Education credit will only satisfy one year of experience.” <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/experience-requirements ">(www.isc2.org, n.d.)</a></p>

				<p>I believe I currently have the knowledge required in vulnerability management as I have vast experience in the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Vulnerability management - Rapid7 which is the industry standard tool in vulnerability management due to its cheap cost to run. </li>
					<li>Cloud Security – I work closely with Cloud Architects daily and have exposure to tools such as CloudApp Security and Azure Sentinel.</li>
					<li>NIDS – I have completed the Check Point Certified Admin (CCSA) course and plan on taking the certification exam after COVID-19 restrictions ease. I also have experience in tools such as Cisco’s StealthWatch which I deployed to Brisbane City Council’s network.</li>
					<li>PAM – I use and maintain BeyondInsight (a PAM tool developed by BeyondTrust) on a daily basis </li>
				</ul>

				<p>I plan to build on my knowledge and qualifications by completing a range of relevant courses that are desirables in the cyber security industry. Firstly, this year I plan on certifying in CCSA. Secondly, I will continue to enhance my resume by clocking years of experience at work whilst working on my degree. Once I have finished my degree, I will be able to sit my CISSP exam and will have the years’ experience required to have full CISSP qualification as opposed to just being an Associated of (ISC)². On completion of obtaining my CISSP I would ask to onboard senior responsibilities at my current workplace thereby gaining the senior experience required.</p>
