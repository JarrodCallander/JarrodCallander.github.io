				<h1>Project Description</h1>
				<p>One member from a household would download the app or visit the website and create an account. During initial account creation they will be asked if they are setting up a household or joining a household. Once they create the household, they will be able to invite other members (by sending a text message or email). The invited members create an account by following the link and are automatically added to the household or alternatively if they already have an account, they can be added by scanning a QR code or entering an invite code.</p>
				<p>In the app there are two distinct areas: personal and household. The household section is where users can add bills. When one member sets up a bill in the household section, they set up the bill frequency, how the bill is paid (BPAY, bank transfer, etc.), and set the percentages paid by each member. Once one member enters the details for a household bill the other members of the household receive an alert and can either accept or deny the bill settings. A key feature of the app is that all members must accept the settings before the bill can be charged.</p>
				<p>Once a billâ€™s percentages and frequency has been accepted by all members of the household the primary member is able to pay the bills. BPAY and bank transfer bills are paid by selecting the associated bill name and entering the amount that is required to be paid (if not fixed). For bills or purchases that require a card a member will use the virtual card number associated with the household account. Once they attempt to process the payment the primary household member will receive a notification from the app with details of the payment attempting to be made and will then select which bill it is so the appropriate amounts can be withdrawn from the users.</p>
				<p>In the personal section users can set up details such as their payment method(s) and access their virtual card number which will be able to be used for online shopping. The use of the virtual card will trigger a notification from the app prompting the user to approve or deny the transaction. If the transaction is not approved within a designated time, the transaction will be reversed by the app and a lockout period of 30 minutes will occur. If multiple transactions are reversed in a row the personal card number will be disabled until the user is able to prove their identity to support.</p>
				<p>The design of this app means that users will no longer have to worry about credit card details being stolen and identity theft as each purchase made with the personal number must be approved, the original settings for household payments must also be approved by all members, and finally payments made using the household card number must be approved by the primary household member.</p>
