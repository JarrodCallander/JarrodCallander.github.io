				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<p>I had no training in IT when I joined the Navy, but I was trained to become a Communications and Information Systems (CIS) sailor and that is where my love for IT started. Whilst in the Navy I had a variety of responsibilities and slowly progressed in my career until I became a system administrator onboard <a href="https://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-hobart-iii">HMAS Hobart</a> – a first-of-class DDG and Australia’s most capable warship. On Hobart I was responsible for four enclaves, managing hundreds of workstations across a variety of servers, of different classifications and security: supporting over 180 personnel in an operation environment.</p>

				<p>In my last year in the Navy I was selected to undertake cyber security training to become a cyber security analyst. This training was hosted by the US Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center and was the most technical training I have completed to date. The nine-month course cemented my desire to work in the cyber security sector for the rest of my professional career. Due to personal reasons I left the Navy to move back to Brisbane where I now work as a Network Analyst at Brisbane City Council’s Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC).</p>

				<p>At the beginning of 2020 I decided that I should bolster my resume with formal education so I would not be overlooked by potential future employees as I attempt to move up the corporate ladder. I looked at several different courses and originally wanted to apply for a Bachelor of Cyber Security through another university but ultimately decided it would be more beneficial to get a Bachelor of IT and then pursue cyber related post-graduate courses on completion. RMIT’s flexible study options were one of the major deciding factors that ultimately led me to enrol through OUA among other reasons.</p>

				<p>Throughout my study journey at RMIT I expect to learn more broad IT concepts that I missed in my previous IT journey – which was mainly focused on administration and security. I would love to learn more about web design as this is a relatively foreign concept to me outside of inspecting and testing webpages for vulnerabilities. I think gaining more knowledge of all other areas of IT would help strengthen my abilities as a cyber security analyst.</p>
