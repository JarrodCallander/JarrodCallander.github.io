				<h1>Summary of tests</h1>

				<p>The results of these tests do not come as a real surprise to me. In the Myers-Briggs test I expected to test as the Executive. I believe that things should have a structure which probably came from my navy background. I truly believe that being honest is a key value and that people should stick up for their values. In previous courses I have conducted in the Navy, I was taught the importance of the different leadership styles and always thought I fit well in the democratic style of leadership which happens to fit well with the Executive personality. My initial thoughts on the results of my learning style was that I thought I could have been closer to even in the visual and tactile space as I think if I see something done I usually have a generally good idea on how it is done. On further reflection though I realise that I tend to start using a new tool or clicking around something to figure out how it works â€“ which matches the results of this test. Finally, the psychometric test seems to be accurate as I have done similar tests in the past when taking part in the cyber security selection process in the Navy. These results showed that I had an above average to high level of analytical and problem-solving skillset. </p>
				<p>The results of these tests will help me reflect on my strengths and weaknesses in a team environment. I believe I will be dedicated to my team and will be highly unlikely to drop out of the task. I also believe I will be honest to my team members which will help facilitate a positive environment for strong ideas. I will need to be mindful of other ideas as Executives tend to be inflexible and stubborn <a href=": https://www.16personalities.com/estj-strengths-and-weaknesses">(NERIS Analytics Limited, 2013).</a> My analytical nature should help mitigate my stubborn tendencies provided I can be objective. I will need to discuss with my team members that I will need to be able to see or experience our idea/project as I find it difficult to understand something just from hearing it. </p>
				<p>When formulating my team, I would try to find team members that had the same learning style as me. Ultimately, I would like to be in a team full of analytical members as I believe analytical people are the people I work best with and the people I have the most experience with. In the personality space, I would try to avoid being in a group with other Executives as there may be conflict. I think it would be best to get a good spread of the different personalities as this will mean we have a decent spread of strengths and weaknesses and not face serious interpersonal issues.</p>
