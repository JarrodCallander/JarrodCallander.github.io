				<h1>Project Motivation</h1>

				<p>I recently moved into an apartment with my girlfriend of 1 year and our mutual friend from high school. Rent and extra bills started coming in and were being split differently, come in at different times and vary in cost month-to-month. The current solution to this is old fashioned – a calculator. Say a house has rent due on Friday – One member would pay the bill, let the others know it has been paid and they will transfer their amounts. It is a Friday meaning a delay in transfers between banks, so the paying member now goes the weekend hundreds of dollars out of pocket. The app will pay the bill using a virtual account and automatically debit the accounts meaning know unnecessary bank transfers and no one out of pocket.</p>
